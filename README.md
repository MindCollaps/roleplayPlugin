# Roleplay Plugin
This plugin is based on the Minecraft Bukkit api and is programmed in Java.
This plugin alows a group of players, to play a roleplay based game. Every one gets a role with diffrent abilities and all together have one thing to do...find the murder, or if you are the murder, hide your role.

Have fun ;3
